# Block Detection Refinements Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented Features

### 1. **Parameterization in config.yaml**
All requested parameters have been added to `config.yaml` under `image_occlusion`:

```yaml
# --- Block detection refinements ---
morph_kernel_width: 25   # Morphology kernel width (default 25)
morph_kernel_height: 25  # Morphology kernel height (default 25)
dbscan_eps: 50           # DBSCAN eps for clustering OCR boxes
dbscan_min_samples: 1    # DBSCAN min_samples for clustering
min_block_area: 200      # Minimum area for a block after merging/post-processing
table_merge_band: 20     # Max center alignment band (px) for row/col merging
centroid_merge_dist: 30  # Max centroid distance (px) for merging
iou_merge_thresh: 0.2    # IoU threshold for merging blocks
```

### 2. **Post-processing of merged block list**
Implemented `postprocess_blocks()` function that:
- ✅ Merges any two boxes whose IoU > 0.2 or centroids within 30px
- ✅ Drops any block with area < 200 px²
- ✅ Only merges boxes in same row/column if centers align within 20px band
- ✅ Applies table heuristics for structured content

### 3. **FORCE_MASK_DEBUG overlays maintained**
- ✅ Bright green boxes are generated for all debug images
- ✅ Debug overlays show the detected blocks clearly
- ✅ Both morphology blocks and cluster fallback generate debug images

### 4. **Enhanced logging**
Added comprehensive debug logging showing:
- ✅ Which path was taken (morphology vs clustering vs post-merge)
- ✅ Final block count per image
- ✅ Merging decisions with IoU and distance values
- ✅ Area filtering results

## Test Results

### Configuration Verification
```
=== Block Detection Configuration ===
Morphology kernel: (25, 25)
DBSCAN eps: 50
DBSCAN min_samples: 1
Min block area: 200
Table merge band: 20
Centroid merge distance: 30
IoU merge threshold: 0.2
```

### Debug Output Examples
```
[DEBUG] Morphology blocks: 3
[DEBUG] Merged into 1 block-level regions.
[DEBUG] Fallback not needed: morphology blocks used
[DEBUG] Final block count after post-processing: 1

[DEBUG] Morphology produced zero blocks, falling back to OCR clustering.
[DEBUG] OCR clusters: 4
[DEBUG] Fallback used: OCR clustering
[DEBUG] Final block count after post-processing: 4
```

### Generated Debug Images
- ✅ `debug_slide11_img1_blocks.png` - Morphology path with bright green boxes
- ✅ `debug_slide13_img1_blocks.png` - Morphology path with bright green boxes  
- ✅ `debug_slide14_img1_blocks_cluster.png` - DBSCAN fallback with bright green boxes
- ✅ Multiple other debug images showing both detection paths

## Key Improvements

1. **Parameterized Control**: All block detection parameters are now configurable via `config.yaml`
2. **Robust Post-processing**: Intelligent merging with IoU, centroid distance, and table heuristics
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Clear visibility into which detection path was used and why
4. **Visual Debugging**: Bright green boxes make it easy to verify coverage of multi-word labels, headers, and callouts
5. **Fallback Handling**: Graceful fallback from morphology to DBSCAN clustering when needed

## Verification

The implementation successfully:
- ✅ Covers multi-word labels with bright green boxes
- ✅ Covers headers and callouts appropriately  
- ✅ Uses configurable parameters for fine-tuning
- ✅ Provides detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Maintains FORCE_MASK_DEBUG overlays
- ✅ Regenerates debug images with improved block detection

All requested refinements have been implemented and are working correctly!
